## Spatial Databases IDCE 376 | Assignment 2: | Clio Bate | 02/14/2024

This project was created as part of the class, Spatial Databases at Clark University Spring, 2024. The objective of this assignent is to introduce database normalization and implement these concepts by creating our own non-normal database, and normalizing it to 1NF and 2NF.  
The full assignment instructions for the assignment can be found on the class website, [here](https://studyingplace.space/spatial-database/labs/A2-Database_Normalization.html)

### This repository includes
1. analysis.sql : SQL script for creating and normalizing tables
2. Report.MD (this document): A Markdown or text file containing your normalization report.
3. Screenshots showing your final table structures in pgAdmin or the command-line outputs.
